## Shared UI Framework – Border Window (Partial)

This folder contains a partial snapshot of the frameless window framework used internally at my internship company.

Both projects in this repository (“Collaboration Tool New Project Dialog” and
“Wind Field Inspector”) were originally integrated with this shared border
window system. Due to company confidentiality, only the core frame logic is
included here as a code sample, and it is not wired into the demo projects in
this public repository.
